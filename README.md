## Tech/framework used

#### Built with
- [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/)
- [FBS](https://build-system.fman.io/)

## Features ####
> 1. Create random colored circles in the Canvas area on clicking the "Add" button.
> 2. The circles have the following properties:
>    1. They get added to random places on the canvas.
>    2. They have a text label which the user can modify at any time.
> 3. The added circles can be repositioned in the Canvas area.
> 4. The added circles can be deleted from the Canvas area.
> 5. Two circles can be connected using a black line.Two or more circles can simply be selected to connected them, the lines have a text label which the user can modify at any time.
> 6. A pdf report can be generated displaying the connection between different circles on clicking the "Generate Report" button.
> 7. An image file as png can be saved of whatever is displayed in the canvas area on clicking the "Save" button.

## Code overview #

> #### src/main/python/main.py
> Implements the main window with the toolbar using QHBoxLayout, and the canvas using QGraphicsScene on a QDialog

> #### src/main/python/shapes.py
> Implements the shapes to be drawn on canvas, the Circle using QGraphicsEllipseItem, the connection line using QGraphicsLineItem, the name label using QGraphicsTextItem and grip items using QGraphicsPathItem

## API Reference

The QtForPython docs were used to implement the program, one can reference them here 
- [QtForPython](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/contents.html)
The docs for Qt for C++ library can be found here
- [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/)

## How to use?

- To add a circle, Press the **add** button to add a new circle. a
- To delete a circle, Press the **Del** or the **Backspace** key on your keyboard with the circle selected
- To add a connection, Select two or more circles then press **Space** to add connections
- To change any label, simply **click** on any text to enter edit mode.
- Click on **save** or **generate report** to save canvas as png or generate a report in pdf format, the files are saved as Output.png and Output.pdf respectively

## Afternote and credits
Apart from the screening phase requirement, this project was a really valuable experience, and I have learnt so much while building this
Additionally, I would like to thank [@eyllanesc](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6622587/eyllanesc) over at stack overflow for helping me resolve a few minor issues with PyQt
